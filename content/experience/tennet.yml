  These services were monitored and had alerting enabled using ElasticSearch.
activities:
  - Developing ingestion services using Python, deployed using GitOps to container orchestration platform
  - Enabling deployment of Grafana using GitOps onto container orchestration platform
  - Improving and stimulating innovation relating to security processes through standardization and automation
  - Enabling developers to run VS-code on the container platform; debugging from within the network
  - Developing multi threaded Python service to ingest data using Nifi
  - Enabling deployment of Database (DaaS) using GitOps
  - Managing prerequisites of ingestion services; ACLs, service user, HDFS, Kafka etc.
  - Creation of Dashboards visualizing ingestion metrics using Kibana
  - Configuration of Filebeat on container orchestration to forward to Logstash (ElasticSearch)
  - Enabling deployment of ElasticSearch watchers using GitOps for alerting to Slack and email
